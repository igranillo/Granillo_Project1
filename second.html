	<p>This game has been one of my most anticipated games for the past 13 years and it has finally arrived! Unfortunetly this game is very time consuming and with the amount of school work and work, I barely have any time to play this game ughhh!</p>

	<p>This game is just used to kill some time and have some quick gameplay. Matches usually last around fifteen minutes, making it a great game to take breaks from schoolwork.</p>

	<p>This is a quick paced fighting game that can be played virtually anywhere with the portability of the Nintendo Switch console. Perfect to play in between classes.</p>
