			<li>
				<img src="pictures/tnk" alt="The new Kid by Temple Mathews">
				<p>The new Kid series was one of my most favorite supernatural books when I was younger and actually had time to read for fun.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="pictures/tnktr" alt="The rising by Temple Mathews">
				<p>The second installment in the new kid series by temple Mathews. It is a bit cliche, but what supernatural book isn't.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="pictures/tnktsoa" alt="The Sword of Armageddon">
				<p>The third and final instalment in the new kid series by temple Mathews. It is probably my favorite one mostly because it shows how much the protagonist has progressed and has to use all his experience to overcome the obstacles presented to him.</p>
